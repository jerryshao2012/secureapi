# node-secure-api
The secure api library provides a set of security APIs for enrollment, authentication and authorization.

## Usage
### `node bin/www`

Start secure API services. A default admin account will be created if it is not existing.

Protected APIs need to be accessed through authenticated token in bearer header. Check postman collection for sample requests.

### Configuration
  
Secure API is using MongoDB. MongoDB configuration is defined in root/config.js.
````
// Database URL
database: "mongodb://localhost:27017/secureapi"
````
Session timeout: please check [JSON Web Tokens](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)
````
// Expires in 24 hours
expiresIn: "24h"
````
Enrollment:
````
tempUserCollection: "tempUsers",
expirationTime: 600, // 10 minutes
verificationURL: "http://localhost:" + port + "/api/v1/email-verification/${URL}",
transportOptions: {
    service: "Gmail",
    auth: {
        user: "awesomeapp.api@gmail.com",
        pass: "*******"
    }
},
verifyMailOptions: {
    from: "Do Not Reply <myawesomeemail_do_not_reply@gmail.com>",
    subject: "Please confirm account",
    html: "Click the following link to confirm your account:</p><p>${URL}</p>",
    text: "Please confirm your account by clicking the following link: ${URL}"
},
````
Authentication level: level2, level1, level0
````
level0: {
    urls: '/',
    through: ''
},
level1: {
    urls: ['/api/v1/keyPair', '/api/v1/api-docs'],
    through: 'basic',
    scope: "admin"
},
level2: {
    urls: '/api/v1',
    through: 'jwt'
},
level3: {
    urls: '/api/v2',
    through: 'web'
}

#### Context urls matching

[RFC 3986 `urls`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3) is used for context matching.

```
         foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
```

* **path matching**
    - `urls: ''` - matches any path, all requests will be proxied.
    - `urls: '/'` - matches any path, all requests will be proxied.
    - `urls: '/api'` - matches paths starting with `/api`

* **multiple path matching**
    - `urls: ['/api', '/ajax', '/someotherpath']` 

* **wildcard path matching**
    
    For fine-grained control you can use wildcard matching. Glob pattern matching is done by _micromatch_. Visit [micromatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromatch) or [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) for more globbing examples.
    - `urls: '**'` matches any path, all requests will be proxied.
    - `urls: '**/*.html'` matches any path which ends with `.html`
    - `urls: '/*.html'` matches paths directly under path-absolute
    - `urls: '/api/**/*.html'` matches requests ending with `.html` in the path of `/api`
    - `urls: ['/api/**', '/ajax/**']` combine multiple patterns
    - `urls: ['/api/**', '!**/bad.json']` exclusion

* **custom matching**
    
    For full control you can provide a custom function to determine which requests should be proxied or not.
    ```
    /**
     * @return {Boolean}
     */
    var filter = function (pathname, req) {
        return (pathname.match('^/api') && req.method === 'GET');
    };

    ...
    level1: {
        urls: filter,
        through: 'basic',
        scope: "admin"
    }
    ...
    ```
    
### Postman collection

Postman collection is located in root/secure.APIs.postman.collection.json.

## Testing
Integrated with postman collection, mocha, chai, chai-http. After install Mocha:
````
npm install mocha chai chai-http --save-dev

````
Just run:
````
npm test
````
## API documentation

* Swagger 2 standard API documentation can be accessed at /api/v1/api-docs such as localhost:6002/api/v1/api-docs if server is launched on port 6002 locally. The link is protected by default admin account.

## Logs

Beside log through winston, api & web access logs are located in root/logs/all-logs.log.

Log level and format is defined in root/config.js.
````
// Log level & format
logFormat: "dev"

````
## Web reference application for Secure API
Use brower to access:
````
http://localhost:6002/api/v2/home
````
Note: contains reference implementation for password recovery / sign up / remember me

## Fast elliptic-curve cryptography
[Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC requires smaller keys compared to non-ECC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to provide equivalent security. Reference implementation for how to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography library in web application with NodeJS [crypto module](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.htm).

Note: For web client side, the generated client side elliptic key will be kept in local storage.

## Protected reverse proxy

Upgrade [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) to be a protected reverse proxy.

Sample configurations show how to reverse proxy https://www.google.com and http://www.example1.org:
````
    junctions: [
        // Check https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware for how to config reverse proxy
        {
            context: ['/api/v2/sales', '/logos', '/images', '/xjs', '/logos', '/gen_204'],
            options: {
                target: 'https://www.google.com',
                changeOrigin: true,
                pathRewrite: {
                    '^/api/v2/sales': ''           // Remove path
                }
            }
        },
        {
            context: '/api/v2/dashboard',
            options: {
                target: 'http://www.example1.org',  // target host
                changeOrigin: true,                 // needed for virtual hosted sites
                ws: true,                           // proxy websockets
                pathRewrite: {
                    '^/api/v2/dashboard/old-path': '/api/new-path',     // rewrite path
                    '^/api/v2/dashboard/remove/path': '/path'           // remove base path
                },
                router: {
                    // when request.headers.host == 'dev.localhost:3000',
                    // override target 'http://www.example.org' to 'http://localhost:8000'
                    'dev.localhost:3000': 'http://localhost:8000'
                }
            }
        }
    ]
```` 
[http://localhost:6002/api/v2/sales](http://localhost:6002/api/v2/sales) is protected by Secure API authentication. Only successful authenticated user can access it.
